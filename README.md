## What is STALKERText?

Inspired by the book Roadside Picnic and the subsequent Movies & Game spinoffs, STALKERText is a text-based RPG written in LUA.

## Why STALKERText?

I like text-based RPGs.

I also wanted to do the following:

- Game engine from scratch (Easy because text-based)
- Write in Lua in case I want to throw a Love2D render on top of the code later
- Easy to understand/extend if you have little programming knowledge
- Generic RPG framework to tell all kinds of stories
- NO AI

## What is the game loop?

- Enter the ZONE
- Find a new room
- Fight enemies or find LOOT
- Rinse & repeat!
